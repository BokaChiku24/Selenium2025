Selenium WebDriver Architecture Information

1) The WebDriver client translate the commands from your script into HTTP requests
   following the W3C WebDriver protocol.

2) Why W3C WebDriver Protocol?
   All modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) natively support the W3C protocol,
   ensuring consistent behavior.

3) These HTTP request are sent to the Browser Driver:
   What is Browser Driver?
   Each browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) has its own dedicated driver.
   This driver is a small program tha acts as a translator between the WebDriver protocol and the browser itself.

4) Finally the browser drivers interpret the HTTP request and control the actual web browser,
   carrying out the actions your test scripts define (opening pages, clicking button, filling forms, etc)

5) The browser executes the commands and return the response to the driver, which delayed back to the WebDriver client.
