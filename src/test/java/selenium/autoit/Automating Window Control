Automating Window Control with Selenium and AutoIt

1) Handling Windows Authentication Pop-up
   e.g. http://username:password@siteURL

2) Handling File Upload from Windows using AutoIT

*********************************************************

1) What is AutoIt?
   - AutoIt is a scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting.
   - It can simulate keystrokes, mouse movements, and window commands to automate tasks.

2) Install AutoIt
   - Download AutoIt from https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/
   - Install the software.
   - Open the exe installer and follow the installation instructions.
   - Select the default options during installation.
   - Select the 'Run the script' option if prompted.
   - Select the full installation option.
   - Set the installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3`).


3) AutoIt Script for File Upload
   - Create a new AutoIt script file (e.g., `fileUpload.au3`).
   - Write the script to handle the file upload dialog.

4) Integrate AutoIt with Selenium
   - Use the AutoIt script in your Selenium tests to handle file uploads.

*********************************************************

Writing AutoIt Script for File Upload:

1) Open the AutoIt Script Editor from SciTE
   - Navigate to the AutoIt installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3\SciTE`).
   - Open the SciTE editor.
   - Write the AutoIt script to handle the file upload dialog.

Steps:
    - Shift focus to the file upload dialog window
    - Send the file path to the dialog
    - Click the Open button to upload the file
    - Open the Au3Info_64.exe tool to get the window title and control IDs
    - Click on the "Finder Tool" button
    - Spy on the file upload dialog to get the control IDs
    - Use the control IDs in your AutoIt script
    - Use the `ControlFocus` and `ControlSetText` functions to interact with the dialog controls
    - Save the script with a `.au3` extension in the AutoIt directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3\Scripts\fileUpload.au3`).
    - Compile the script to an executable using the AutoIt compiler (Right-click the script file and select "Compile Script").
    - This will create an executable file (e.g., `fileUpload.exe`) that can be run from your Selenium tests.
    - Invoke the compiled AutoIt script from your Selenium test code using the `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method.

    - Au3info_64.exe is a tool that comes with AutoIt to help you find window titles and control IDs for automation.
    - Build script - scite.exe is the editor for AutoIt scripts.
    - Convert file into executable - Right-click on the script file and select "Compile Script" to create an executable.
    - Call Runtime.getRuntime().exec() in your Selenium test code to run the AutoIt script.

Script Example:

ControlFocus("Open", "", "Edit1") ; Focus on the file input field // Edit1: Class + Instance concatenation
ControlSetText("Open", "", "Edit1", "C:\path\to\your\file.txt") ; Set the file path
ControlClick("Open", "", "Button1") ; Click the Open button
