Synchronization in Selenium:

Entered Form and Select movie/fligt enter
Search:
Load 3 seconds
First flight search result: Script will fail - no such Element

1) Implicit Wait:
   Wait for 'n' number of seconds and listen to the DOM before you throw exception
   Apply 5 seconds but Element appears in 2 seconds script skips remaining 3 seconds and resume execution
   In implicit wait it applies globay in the script for tags in the DOM.
   Code looks readable and optimize

   Disadvantage:
   Suppose there are 100 test cases and for one search result it takes 5 seconds and one specific search result it takes
   15 seconds.
   Now here, we have provided 5 seconds in implicit wait and for 15 seconds script will fail.
   Workaround is make implicit wait 15 seconds but it is bad idea.
   Now suppose 100 cities are returining result in 4-5 seconds and due to some issue in the application it start
   returning 10-13 seconds in this case this issue will not catch because of this 15 seconds of the implicit wait.
   Apart from this test execution speed slows down - suppose 2-4 cities have some error
   SO selenium will wait 15 seconds and then it will throw error and this will repeat for error cities.
   Note: Better to keep it minium as per your web-site standard or team lead or manager suggest

2) Explicit Wait:
   It target only specific element and we can set the desired time for that element.
   It is applicable to specific situation

   Very Important: Implicit and Explicit both are combinly used to achive goals. For 1000 test cases we can't rely on eplicit
   wait.

3) Fluent Wait:

4) Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(5000)):
   It is java parat. It is hard coded pause the script. It is forcefully stop the execution even though
   result is appeared within the time. It not skips the time just likje implicit or explicit wait.
